    <h1>What is Food?</h1>
    <p>The importance of food is obvious and essential. Healthy food provides us the nutrients and energy to develop and
        grow,be active and healthy, to move, play, work, think and learn.Foods are directly related to our body and
        mental and social health because each food or liquid contains particular nutrition such as carbohydrates,
        protein, vitamins, minerals, fats, etc, which are very necessary for our physical and mental growth.Food and
        water are the main sources of nutrition and strengthening the body, but many of the foods we eat do not have
        any nutritional values.On the contrary, they lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.
        Therefore, you should choose healthy and balanced foods that can provide enough nutritional value for the
        body.

        important role in the promotion of health and disease prevention. In general, it consists of essential
        nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins which are consumed to provide

    <p>We must know that the terms 'food' and 'nutrition' are sometimes used synonymously, which is not correct
        completely.Food is a composite mixture of various ingredients that are consumed for nutrition.On the other hand,
        nutrition connotes a dynamic process in which swallowed food is utilized by the human body for nourishment.
        As much as we eat, our body gets nourished. When there is an insufficient intake of protein, energy or
        carbohydrate, there is often illness or infection.

    <h2>Food Sources</h2>
    <p>Foods are secured through several methods: agriculture, hunting, gathering, etc. The detailed statement is that
        most food has its origin in plants.Some food is derived directly from plants, but even animals are also used as
        food sources that are picked up by feeding food from plants. Some foods are not directly obtained from animal or
        plant sources they are obtained from various edible fungi,especially mushrooms. Fungi and ambient bacteria are
        used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods likeleavened bread, alcoholic drinks, cheese, pickles,
        etc.Another example is blue-green algae such as Spirulina.Inorganic substances such as baking soda, salt, and
        tartar cream are used to preserve or chemically convert a component.

            How can food affect mood?</h1>
        <p>Knowing what foods we should and shouldn't be eating can be really confusing, especially when it feels like
            the
            advice changes regularly. However, evidence suggests that as well as affecting our physical health, what we
            eat
            may also affect the way we feel.</p>

                include: pasta, rice, oats, wholegrain bread and cereals, nuts and seeds.

            <dt><strong>Getting enough protein</strong></dt>
            <dd>Protein contains amino acids, which make up the chemicals your brain needs to regulate your thoughts and
                feelings. It also helps keep you feeling fuller for longer.</dd>
            <dt>Eating the right fats</dt>
            <dd>Your brain needs fatty acids (such as omega-3 and -6) to keep it working well. So rather than avoiding
                all
                fats, it's important to eat the right ones.
